Explain Version Control

Version control is a system that tracks changes made to a file or folder. It's important because it helps you identify and fix errors in your code and collaborate effectively with others. For example, in a team, everyone may be working on different codes, but with version control, everyone's changes are known to everyone. That's why we use the 'git commit -m "message"' command, which allows us to record changes with a description. Version control thus allows us to be efficient, reliable, and productive in software development.
