# cse210-ww-student-template
This is the starter code for students in the worldwide content version of CSE 210.

This repository contains the starter code for many different projects. They are arranged folders by week. There is also an an empty sandbox project that can be used to play around with any concept you would like.

Version Control â€“ Explain:

Version control is a system that tracks changes made to a file or folder. It's important because it allows you to identify and correct errors in your code and collaborate effectively.

Highlight a benefit:

Version control allows collaboration between multiple developers without overwriting each other's work. It also improves reliability, productivity, and efficient software development.

Example of version control:

For example, within a team, everyone may be working on different code, but with version control, everyone's changes are known to everyone.

A command is:

git commit -m "Added login feature"
 

Thoroughly explain these concepts :

Version control is a system that allows you to track, manage, and record changes made to project files, typically in software development. Its strength is that it records changes at any time, meaning that each change can be viewed by another programmer, corrected, or compared to previous versions using commit messages. In the event of an error, it is possible to revert to a previous version without losing any work, which significantly improves the security and reliability of the project.
Version control also facilitates collaboration. This means that multiple developers can work simultaneously on different parts of the same project without disrupting each other's work.
